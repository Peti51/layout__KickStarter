The landing page features a form and a card carousel. The script included on the page enhances the user experience and provides functionality to the form and card carousel.

The form validation script ensures that the user provides a name and email before submitting the form. If either field is left empty, error messages are displayed, and the form submission is prevented until the required information is provided. Upon submission, the form is reset, ready for the next entry.

The card carousel allows the user to navigate through multiple cards. By clicking the next button, the displayed card changes, and the corresponding number updates. The carousel also supports backward navigation by clicking the previous button. The script keeps track of the current card using a count variable and updates the visibility of the cards accordingly.
