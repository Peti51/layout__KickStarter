The website utilizes various HTML elements, CSS styles, and JavaScript code to create the structure, design, and functionality of the site. It uses responsive design techniques to ensure the website adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.

Regarding the technologies used in this project, here are some key points:

HTML: The website structure and content are created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML tags are used to define elements such as headers, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

CSS: The website's visual appearance and layout are defined using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS styles are applied to HTML elements to control their presentation, including fonts, colors, positioning, and responsiveness.

JavaScript: The JavaScript code in the provided script file (main.js) adds interactivity and functionality to the website. It includes event listeners for form submission and button clicks, form validation, and a slideshow effect for the features section.

Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, meaning it adjusts its layout and content to provide an optimal viewing experience on different devices and screen sizes. This is achieved using CSS media queries and responsive design techniques.

External Libraries and Resources: The website includes external resources such as Google Fonts for custom fonts, font icons, and images hosted on external servers.
